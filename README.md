### License ###
This software is licensed under the highly restrictive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 2.0</a> or later.
If this license doesn't suit you: you're doing it wrong.


### What it does? ###
It simply auto refresh the browser window when it gets focus.


### Why/WTF? ###
While coding i switch between the editor and the browser(s) to check my changes (especially if it is html/css).

Usually i do CMD+TAB / CTRL+TAB to switch windows and then click the browser
Refresh button (or F5).
I was trying to reduce this overhead.

Some editors let you define some kind of Run/Build/Launch button key that open the file that you are editing
in your default browser.
This sucks for many reasons.

There are already some apps/plugins but they are not cross-editor / cross-platform / cross-browser.
With this (simple) script i can work on any editor and any browsers without installing anything.


### Usage ###
In the page(s) that you are working add:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://os.hugorodrigues.com/reloadOnFocus.js"></script>

Now next time you switch between any app and the browser the page will be automatically reloaded.


### Limitations ###
For sure there are many. Give it a try.
